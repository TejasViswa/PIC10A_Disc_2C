# Exercises

## Question 1

Write a program that prints all solutions to the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$. Remember that the solutions are: $$\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ and $$\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ Read in $a$, $b$, $c$ and use the quadratic formula. If the discriminant $b^2−4ac$ is negative, display a message stating that there are no solutions.

## Question 2

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (1 for January, 2 for February, and so on) and then prints the number of days in the month. For February, print “28 or 29 days”.
```
Enter a month: 5
30 days
```

## Question 3

Write a program that takes user input describing a playing card in the following shorthand notation:
```
A         - Ace
2 ... 10  - Card Values
J         - Jack
Q         - Queen
K         - King
D         - Diamond
H         - Hearts
S         - Spades
C         - Clubs
```
Your program should print the full description of the card. For example,
```
Enter the card notation: QS
Queen of spades
```
