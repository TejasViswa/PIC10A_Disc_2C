# Problems

## Question 1:
Write a program to emulate a simple calculator using switch statements.
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two numbers: 
2.3
4.5
2.3 + 4.5 = 6.8
```
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): -
Enter two numbers: 
2.3
4.5
2.3 - 4.5 = -2.2
```

## Question 2:
Write a program to enter a sequence of non-negative integers and find their sum and print if the sum is a multiple of 3, 5 or both. The sequence of inputs gets terminated when the user enters -1.
```
Input(Enter -1 to quit): 1 2 1 8 8 9 -1
Output: 29 is neither a multiple of 3 nor 5
```
```
Input(Enter -1 to quit): 7 8 -1 
Output: 15 is multiple of both 3 and 5
```
```
Input(Enter -1 to quit): 2 1 3 -1 
Output: 6 is multiple of 3
```

## Question 3:
Print the following pattern using a for loop:
```
* * *
$ $ $
* * *
$ $ $
* * *
$ $ $
```
